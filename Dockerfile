### NOTES
# 1. In order to fully test the build, you must run the image
#    with:  --cap-add sys_admin
#    because clients of the halo server use perf_events.
#    If you are just running Halo Server, this is not required and it is
#    reccomended to _not_ enable sys_admin.
#
# 2. For self: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/
#    for tips on writing a good docker file.

# tell tzdata we can't answer its questions about time zones!
