This research was supported by the Exascale Computing
Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S.
Department of Energy organizations (Office of Science and
the National Nuclear Security Administration) responsible for
the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem,
including software, applications, hardware, advanced system
engineering, and early testbed platforms, in support of the
nation's exascale computing imperative. Additionally, this
research used resources of the Argonne Leadership Computing
Facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility
